"""Write one chapter's extracted canon candidates into Neo4j.

Deliberately NOT folded into `extract_canon.py`. Extraction costs real API
spend; this costs nothing. If a write fails -- bad credentials, a constraint
bug, Neo4j restarting -- re-running it must not re-extract, so the expensive
half runs once and the cheap half runs as often as it needs to.

    uv run python -m backend.scripts.extract_canon "Chapter 3" -o ch3.json
    uv run python -m backend.scripts.write_canon ch3.json --chapter the-village-of-barovia

Every candidate that does not reach the graph is counted and printed. Silent
filtering has twice hidden a defect in this project for weeks.
